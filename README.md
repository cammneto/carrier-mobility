# carrier-mobility
Code to calculate carrier mobility in semiconductors dimers using gaussian09 output files by Marcus-Hush and Marcus-Levich-Jortner models.

In order to use this code you need to download and compile another code from github to calculate the electronic couplings and follow a naming and location pattern for the input files.
