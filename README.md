# carrier-mobility
Code to calculate carrier mobility in organic semi conductors dimers using gaussian09 output files.

In order to use this code you need to download and compile another code from github to calculate the electronic couplings and follow a naming and location pattern for the input files.

Link for the software for calculating the electronic couplings: https://github.com/JoshuaSBrown/QC_Tools

**Citing**
If you use this code to get values for a paper it would be nice if you cited it. This code is related to the paper https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cplett.2020.138226, so for citing it use this paper as citation.
