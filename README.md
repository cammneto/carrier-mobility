# carrier-mobility
Code to estimate carrier mobility in organic semiconductor dimers using gaussian09 output files by Marcus-Hush and Marcus-levitch-Jortner models.

In order to run this code you need to download and compile other code also from github to generate transfer integrals and follow a naming and location pattern for the input files. Once you have compiled the other software just paste its executable to this root.

**Citing**
If you use this code to get values for a paper it would be nice if you cited the original paper https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cplett.2020.138226 related to this code.
